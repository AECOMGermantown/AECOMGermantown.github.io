·         Provision the environment typing in:    vagrant up --provision  inside the project folder where the Vagranfile is located (The provisioning time may take some time to download the image and components.)

·         Working with the environment
·         Inside the environment, the folder  /vagrant/  is mapped to the project folder in your host computer ( i.e.   C:\projects\gsa\   or   /projects/gsa/  )
·         Ports mapped are:
·         Development box: 22 -->> 2222 on host (if 2222 is unused)
·         Development box: 80 -->>  8085 on host
To access the deployed app go to localhost:8085 on your host machine.

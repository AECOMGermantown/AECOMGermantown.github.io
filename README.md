# GSA-Prototype - Link to publicly accessible prototype - http://52.11.38.94/

The AECOM team used a combination of Agile Scrum ad DevOps engineering techniques to facilitate a 1-week sprint to coordinate the prototype project. This included initial project setup and elaboration of requirements, design, development, testing, user acceptance testing, and installation activities. 

We quickly assembled an Scrum team and had them work closely together (mostly collocated, but some distributed). The following team was created to support the prototype project, which incorporated many of the labor categories required under labor pool three (full stack). 

Product Manager (John Keister),
Technical Architect (David McEnderfer),
Back End Web Developer (Charles Tsai), 
Front End Web Developer (Trevor Plumley), 
Front End Web Developer (Alex Bostic),
Interaction Designer (Chris Litz),
DevOps Engineer (Manuel Sanchez)

Through an iterative process we identified the best fit open-source technology tool chain to support development, with a focus on automation and continuous integration. The following tool chain was setup for the prototype project:

- WebStorm IDE for JavaScript, CSS & HTML prototype development
- Leaflet/Mapbox as an open source mapping API
- Angular JS for the applicaiton framework
- SASS as the CSS precompiler
- Angualr UI router, angular-toastr, angular-bootstrap, and lodash for web development libraries
- Jenkins for continous integration 
- Gulp for compilation and builds 
- Karma, Jasmine, Sinon, and Protractor as a set of automated unit testing for JavaScript and Angular
- Github repository with a stream setup based on GitFlow
- Ubuntu web server running Nginx on AWS
- Zabbix for continuous applicaiton monitoring
- Docker as the application container
- Bower & NPM as the Web Package Manager 

Day 1: 
Initial kick-off meeting with team to discuss the scope of work and initial ideas, materials to review, etc. 
Held formal planning meeting, setup scrum board and reviewed visual data driven options (map, charts, etc.). Reviewed openFDA API data sets for consistency and realible data points that we could use to relate the information in a usable format that would benefit the end user. Began to setup user stories based on ideas idenitified during planning.  

Day 2:
Created design comp and sytle guide based on options discussed in planning session. Initial dev mockup was done in real-time, with paired programming techniques to share ideas and implement changes. Backend developers created algorithms to pull necessary content from openFDA API for food, drugs, and devices. Implemented changes in heat map design. 

Day 3:
Reviewed latest version of the prototype 
Setup Google Analystics to support UAT and collect feeback on user nagivation. 

Day 4: 
Updated mapping design based style guide and 

Day 5: 

Day 6: 

Day 7: Final product review, completed RFQ requirements and submitted proposal.

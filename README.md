AECOM Prototype Agile Development Approach - 

Link to publicly accessible prototype - insert link here

The AECOM team used a combination of Agile Scrum ad DevOps engineering techniques to facilitate a 1-week sprint to coordinate the prototype project. This included initial project setup and elaboration of requirements, design, development, testing, user acceptance testing, and installation activities. 

Through an iterative process we identified the best fit open-source technology tool chain to support development, with a focus on automation and continuous integration. The following tool chain was setup for the prototype project:
- WebStorm IDE for JavaScript, CSS & HTML prototype development
- Leaflet/Mapbox as an open source mapping API
- Angular JS for the applicaiton framework
- SASS as the CSS precompiler
- Angualr UI router, angular-toastr, angular-bootstrap, and lodash for web development libraries
- Jenkins for continous integration 
- Gulp for compilation and builds 
- Karma, Jasmine, Sinon, and Protractor as a set of automated unit testing for JavaScript and Angular
- Github repository with a stream setup based on GitFlow
- Ubuntu web server running Nginx on AWS
- Zabbix for continuous applicaiton monitoring
- Docker as the application container
- Bower & NPM as the Web Package Manager 

Day 1: 
Initial kick-off meeting with team to discuss the scope of work and initial ideas, materials to review, etc. 
Held formal planning meeting, setup scrum board and reviewed visual data driven options (map, charts, etc.). Reviewed openFDA API data sets for consistency and realible data points that we could use to relate the information in a usable format that would benefit the end user. Began to setup user stories based on ideas idenitified during planning.  

Day 2:
Created design comp and sytle guide based on options discussed in planning session. Initial dev mockup was done in real-time, with paired programming techniques to share ideas and implement changes. Backend developers created algorithms to pull necessary content from openFDA API for food, drugs, and devices. Implemented changes in heat map design. 

Day 3:
Reviewed latest version of the prototype 
Setup Google Analystics to support UAT and collect feeback on user nagivation. 

Day 4: 
Updated mapping design based style guide and 

Day 5: 

Day 6: 

Day 7: Final product review, completed RFQ requirements and submitted proposal.

3)Understand what people need, by including people in the prototype development and design process
4)Used at least three "human-centered design" techniques or tools
5)created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library
6)
7)
8)
9) 
10)
11)
12)
13)
14)
15)
16) make use of a API, by either consuming or providing one RESTfully.
17) used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype
18) provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine
19) prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge





performed usability tests with people
used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype
created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design
used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.)
deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used
wrote unit tests for their code
set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider
set up or used configuration management
set up or used continuous monitoring
deploy their software in a container (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization)

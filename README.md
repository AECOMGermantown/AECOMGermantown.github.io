Link to publicly accessible prototype - insert link here

The AECOM team used a combination of Agile Scrum ad DevOps engineering techniques to facilitate a 1-week sprint to coordinate the prototype project. This included initial project setup and elaboration of requirements, design, development, testing, user acceptance testing, and installation activities. 

An Agile team was formed with specfic roles assigned based on the following skills:  

Product Manager - John Keister
Technical Architect - David McEnderfer
Back End Web Developer - Charles Tsai
Front End Web Developer -  Trevor Plumley
Front End Web Developer - Alex Bostic
Interaction Designer - Chris Litz 
Usability Tester - Raqulle Carter
DevOps Engineer - Manuel Sanchez

Through an iterative process we identified the best fit open-source technology tool chain to support development, with a focus on automation and continuous integration. The following tool chain was setup for the prototype project 

- WebStorm IDE for JavaScript, CSS & HTML prototype development
- Leaflet/Mapbox as an open source mapping API
- Jenkins for continous integration 
- Gulp for compilation and builds 
- Karma, Jasmine, Sinon, and Protractor as a set of automated unit testing for JavaScript and Angular
- 

Day 1: 
9:30 am  - Initial Kick-off meeting with team to discuss the scope of work and initial ideas, materials to review, etc. 
1pm - formal planning meeting, setup scrum board and reviewed visual data driven options, decided to use all three API data sets. Began to setup user stories based on ideas idenitified during planning.  

Initial dev mockup was done in real-time, with paired programming techniques to share ideas and implement changes. 

Reviewed API data sets for consistency and realible data points that we could use to relate the information in a usable format that would benefit the end user the most. 

Decided on a simple search menu that would be capable of supporting mobile users. 

Main User Stories Indentified 
- Creating a main search menu that is transparent and easy to use on a smaller device 
- Background graphic based on a default search when the page loads. 
- Identified options for a heat map, reviewed open source google map types and selected the best fit
- Used GitHub Pages to continuously publish updates to the web site
- Additional user stories were logged in Visual Studio Online 

Design 
- Created initial design comp based on options discussed in planning session. See prototype design screenshots for details. 

Day 2: 
Team continued to flush out user stories. Finalized site design. Conducted standup meeting at 1pm to review status. 

Day 3:

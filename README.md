Day 1: 
9:30 am  - Initial Kick-off meeting with team to discuss the scope of work and initial ideas, materials to review, etc. 
1pm - formal planning meeting, setup scrum board and reviewed visual data driven options, decided to use all three API data sets. Began to setup user stories based on ideas idenitified during planning.  

Initial dev mockup was done in real-time, with paired programming techniques to share ideas and implement changes. 

Reviewed API data sets for consistency and realible data points that we could use to relate the information in a usable format that would benefit the end user the most. 

Decided on a simple search menu that would be capable of supporting mobile users. 

Main User Stories Indentified 
- Creating a main search menu that is transparent and easy to use on a smaller device 
- Background graphic based on a default search when the page loads. 
- Identified options for a heat map, reviewed open source google map types and selected the best fit
- Used GitHub Pages to continuously publish updates to the web site

Design

Day 2: 
Team continued to flush out user stories. Finalized site design. Conducted standup meeting at 1pm to review status.
